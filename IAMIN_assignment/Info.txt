details

there is only one error that i cant solve it out and that is 
not able to show the saving which is user adding it 

though i have done all the things in this application like 
1 -> user can set goal and its amount 

2 -> user can delete the goal using the
     goal id which they have used for 
     the to assign particular goal 

3 -> user can addd saving through which
      they can monitor there saving (as i mention that there a error)

4 -> user can view there goal and saving
     in a particular window

5->  user can delete its goal 
     after the accomplishment.   

hence i have done all this using java programming langauge 
with hibernate technology
